/**
 The CHRDispatchTimer class allows you to create Grand Central Dispatch-based
 timer objects. A timer waits until a certain time interval has elapsed and then
 fires, executing a given block. 
 
 A timer has limited accuracy when determining the exact moment to fire; the
 actual time at which a timer fires can potentially be a significant period of 
 time after the scheduled firing time.
