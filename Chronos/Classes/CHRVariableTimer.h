#pragma mark - CHRVariableTimer Interface

/**
 The CHRVariableTimer class allows you to create Grand Central Dispatch-based
 timer objects that allow for variable intervals between successive firings.
 
 A timer has limited accuracy when determining the exact moment to fire; the
 actual time at which a timer fires can potentially be a significant period of
 time after the scheduled firing time.
